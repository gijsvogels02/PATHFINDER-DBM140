        <!-- This block explains how the crowd control system protects privacy -->
        Our crowd control system uses overhead cameras and machine learning to analyze crowd flow and density, not to identify individuals. The system is designed so that faces are not recorded. In rare cases where faces may appear in footage, they are automatically blurred to prevent recognition. All video data is securely processed and then deleted after a short period, ensuring that no personal information is stored or shared.
